ClearVoice is a Content Marketing Platform and Marketplace backed by a search index of millions of articles.

We index articles published on the top online news and article sites in real time then extract the content, identify author and collect social metrics for each post.

We then use this dataset to build an unrivalled index of writers to recruit into our marketplace.

Our Engineering Team is tightly integrated with our Product team and we're passionate about learning from eachother.
