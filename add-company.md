<h1>Add a company</h1>

Adding companies to our listings is **Free**. Just create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bradwestfall/webdevphoenix/blob/master/contribute.md) on our GitHub page. The site is built on GitHub Pages using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator. So all you have to do is create your site profile as a markdown file and submit your pull request.
